        <p> Last summer I spent my summer as a software development
            intern at Sila Solutions Group!

            I had a great time building a web application with a team of 4 other interns (all from UVA - boo!).
            I really enjoyed working on a full stack web application and I dove into the Java Spring backend and
            ElasticSearch database especially.

            In my prior summers at JMU I've worked in physics research labs. First, I worked in a lab studying soft
            complex materials and packed system force interactions
            (think grains of sand in a silo). Then, I worked on a Jefferson Lab data aquisiton system for nuclear
            physics. It was in lab work that I discovered my passion
            for programming and got invloved in computer science courses.
